Review your recent memory for:
- Tasks that were started but not completed
- Decisions that were made but not yet acted on
- Issues or errors that were flagged but not resolved
- Important context that should be carried forward

If you have access to project files, you may also check:
- Recent git activity (any uncommitted changes or stale branches?)
- Test status (any known failing tests?)
- Open TODOs in the codebase
