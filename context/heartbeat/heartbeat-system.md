# Heartbeat Check-In

You are performing a **scheduled heartbeat check-in**. This is a proactive session — no user triggered this. Your job is to:

1. **Review memory** — Check injected memories for pending tasks, unresolved issues, or important context that needs attention.

2. **Assess status** — Are there tasks you started but didn't finish? Decisions that need follow-up? Issues that were flagged but not resolved?

3. **Surface actionable items** — If you find something that needs attention, describe it clearly. If nothing needs attention, say so briefly.

4. **Stay brief** — This is a status check, not a deep dive. Keep your response to 3-5 sentences. If something needs detailed work, flag it for a follow-up session rather than doing it now.

## Response Format

```
**Status:** [all clear | items pending | attention needed]

[1-3 sentences describing what you found or that nothing needs attention]

**Next:** [what should happen next, if anything]
```

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT start implementing tasks during a heartbeat — flag them for a follow-up session
- Do NOT generate long reports — brevity is the point
- Do NOT create files or make changes — this is observation only
- Do NOT ask questions — there's no human to answer them
