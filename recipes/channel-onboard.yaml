    approval:
      required: true
      prompt: |
        Channel type: {{channel_type}} ({{channel_name}})

        {{channel_config}}

        Proceed to test authentication with these settings?

  - name: authenticate
    steps:
      - id: store-credentials
        agent: self
        prompt: |
          Store the channel credentials securely.

          Channel: {{channel_type}} ({{channel_name}})
          Configuration: {{channel_config}}

          Use tool-secrets to store each credential:
          - Name format: channel/{{channel_type}}/{{channel_name}}/<credential-name>
          - Category: api_key

          Report which credentials were stored (names only, never values).
        output: credential_storage
        timeout: 120

      - id: test-auth

          2. Attempt to authenticate with the channel's API

        timeout: 120

      - id: pair-device
